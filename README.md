📘 Project Overview

The Heart Disease Prediction System is a machine learning-based project designed to predict the likelihood of heart disease in a patient based on medical attributes such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol level, and more.
The project uses various supervised learning algorithms to analyze health data and predict whether a person is at risk of heart disease.

This system helps doctors and health professionals in early diagnosis and preventive care, improving treatment outcomes and saving lives.

🎯 Objectives

To build an accurate predictive model for detecting heart disease.

To identify the most important medical factors contributing to heart disease.

To automate early diagnosis using machine learning techniques.

To provide an easy-to-use prediction interface for users or healthcare professionals.

⚙️ Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries:

NumPy

Pandas

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Streamlit / Flask (for UI)

Tools: Jupyter Notebook / IBM Watson Studio

Dataset: UCI Heart Disease Dataset or Kaggle Heart Dataset


🧠 Machine Learning Algorithms

The system tests and compares multiple algorithms, such as:

Logistic Regression

(ANN)

🧩 Project Workflow

Data Collection – Load dataset from UCI or Kaggle.

Data Preprocessing – Handle missing values, encode categorical features, and scale data.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Visualize relationships between health indicators and heart disease.

Model Training – Train multiple ML models using Scikit-learn.

Model Evaluation – Evaluate accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Prediction – Input user health parameters and predict disease risk.

Deployment – Deploy via Streamlit or Flask web app for user interaction.
